# TIC-TAC-TOE-Game-Java-
This console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players using Java. The game allows players to take turns entering their moves on a 3x3 grid, alternating between 'X' and 'O'. The board is initialized with empty spaces, and players are prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column indices (ranging from 0 to 2). After each move, the program checks for a winning condition or a draw. The game ends when one player wins by aligning three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the board is full, resulting in a draw
